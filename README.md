Prediction of Floods using Environmental Analysis


Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are highly
complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood prediction models
contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human
life, and reduction the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the
complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past
two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement
of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due
to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among
hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of
the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models.
